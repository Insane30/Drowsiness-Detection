# Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System

### üöó **Stay Alert, Stay Safe!**

Welcome to the **Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System**, a powerful tool designed to help monitor driver alertness and prevent accidents caused by drowsiness. Using cutting-edge technologies like **Python**, **Raspberry Pi**, **OpenCV**, and **Dlib**, this system continuously tracks your facial features and gives immediate feedback when drowsiness is detected.

---

### üí° **Project Overview**

Drowsiness detection is a critical feature in many safety applications, especially for drivers. This system uses face landmark detection to monitor your eye movements and detects signs of fatigue, alerting you with a buzzer and LCD display when it's time to take a break.

### üîß **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The programming language used to bring this system to life.
- **Raspberry Pi**: The brains of the project, running the entire application and handling real-time image processing.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video feed and processing the frames for face detection.
- **Dlib**: For accurate face landmark detection and calculating eye aspect ratio to detect drowsiness.
- **Buzzer**: Alerts the user with sound when drowsiness is detected.
- **LCD Display**: Displays a real-time warning message when the system detects signs of drowsiness.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

1. **Face Detection**: The system uses OpenCV to capture video from a webcam connected to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Landmark Detection**: Dlib is used to detect facial landmarks, focusing on the eyes.
3. **Drowsiness Calculation**: By measuring the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**, the system identifies whether the eyes are closing for too long, a sign of drowsiness.
4. **Alert**: When the EAR falls below a certain threshold, the system sounds a buzzer and displays a warning on the LCD screen.
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: The system runs in real-time, keeping you safe and alert throughout the session.
